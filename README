Block OpenNI
------------
A C++ wrapper for OpenNI


First version:
Support for several generators as Image, IR, Depth, User and Audio.
Skeleton tracking support is also available.



You need to install the sensor drivers, OpenNI and NITE.
PrimeSense drivers do not run with kinect. 
To use a kinect get SensorKinect from avin2 or ros.

Fork charlesdietrich/BlockOpenNI
--------------------------------

Support for Mac OS X. 

Installation instructions for OS X:

First, get libusb and the kinect patch on http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_under_OSX. Patch libusb.

From http://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2614064&amp;tstart=0, do the following:

env CFLAGS="-arch i386" ./configure; make
mv libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.i386
make clean
env CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" ./configure; make
mv libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.x86_64
lipo -create /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.i386 /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.x86_64 -output libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib
sudo make install

Install all the stuff on the OpenNI page. Just grab binaries.

Go to https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect. Download the binary file for OS X. Install.

Change to your blocks directory

git clone https://github.com/charlesdietrich/BlockOpenNI.git

You can now compile. However, you will get an xml error when running.

This is a hack: You need to copy BlockOpenNI/samples/BlockOpenNISample/data  to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Build/Products/Debug/. This should be done with a resource.

Now you should be good to go. If you get No PS sensor is connected! error, try running another Kinect program, and then running again.

Now you can repeat above steps with BlockOpenNISkeleton.
